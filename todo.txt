0) Move utilities into own folder
1) Change the CLI to be a wrapper around an API core
2) init script to create a tspackage.json file (ala npm init)
3) Some sort of repository support
4) Split out tspackage.json facilities into own module so that it can be easily
    consumed from typescript module core


Stuff for a demo/blog - 
	#2
	Implement tspackage support in typescript

Nice for a demo -
